# user-movie-embedding
This project implements user and movie embeddings on top of the MovieLens database using Tensorflow/Keras

It was the result of a graduation project. More information can be obtained on the paper, but the gist is that we try to predict user preferences using matrix factorization as a way to generate user and movie embeddings. User embeddings assign a vector to each user and, likewise, Movie Embeddings assign a vector to each movie such that the movie vector will identify attributes while the user vector will give us information about user preferences for each of those attributes.
